     * <p>If you need your application to run on platform versions prior to API
     * level 5, you can use the following model to handle the older {@link #onStart}
     * callback in that case.  The <code>handleCommand</code> method is implemented by

     * service's main thread.  A service's main thread is the same
     * thread where UI operations take place for Activities running in the
     * same process.  You should always avoid stalling the main
     * thread's event loop.  When doing long-running operations,
     * network calls, or heavy disk I/O, you should kick off a new

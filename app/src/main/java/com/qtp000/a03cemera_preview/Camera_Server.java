     * level 5, you can use the following model to handle the older {@link #onStart}

     * thread where UI operations take place for Activities running in the
     * same process.  You should always avoid stalling the main
     * thread's event loop.  When doing long-running operations,
     * network calls, or heavy disk I/O, you should kick off a new
